# Movie Theatre Practice

# Movie Theater Pricing Problem
#
# We want to take an age(whole number) and a day of the week(str) from the user
# - Use try-except to catch Value Error if invalid age is provided -> exit()
# - Make sure day of the week is stripped & capitalized
#
# Pricing Scheme:
# - Toddlers(less than 5) are free every day
# - Teens(less than 18) on Wednesday are discounted to $5; normal teen price is $7
# - Seniors(65 & older) are discounted for senior Monday special to $4; normal senior price is $6
# - Adults(all others) are discounted on Tuesday to $8; normal adult price is $10
#
# Save the price of the ticket to a price variable, and print the price at the end
# -Use this format: `f"Your ticket price is: ${price}"`
#

    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
